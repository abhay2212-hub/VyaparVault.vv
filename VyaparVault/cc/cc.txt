Processing orders using CCAvenue Billing Page (Non-Seamless)
CCAvenue billing page helps you avoid the hassle of developing and managing your own billing page. CCAvenue billing page is fully customizable enabling you to match the look and feel of your website.

Process flow
1.    	Customer selects product/service on your website and proceeds to make payment.
2.    	Customer is redirected to the CCAvenue billing page where billing, shipping and payment information is entered by the customer.
3.    	On submission of the transaction information, CCAvenue initiates the authorization process by connecting to the relevant bank/processing organization.
4.    	On receiving the authorization status from the bank, CCAvenue sends the response back to your website with the transaction status.


Basic steps involved in integration with the CCAvenue billing page:

Set Up: 
Download the CCAvenue client library as instructed here. You will have to use the CCAvenue transaction file (e.g. ccavRequestHandler.php) to initiate the payment process.
Configure: 
Every merchant receives a unique set of keys for transaction processing. These need to be configured in the transaction file used to initiate the payment process.

From your MARS account under Settings tab -> API Keys page; copy the merchant id, access code and secret encryption. Set these values in the file (e.g. ccavRequestHandler.php) downloaded with the integration kit.
Payment Processing:
You will have to post the order information to the CCAvenue transaction file (e.g. ccavRequestHandler.jsp) to initiate the payment process. CCAvenue transaction file on receiving the order related data will encrypt the data and forward the encrypted request to the CCAvenue billing page.
